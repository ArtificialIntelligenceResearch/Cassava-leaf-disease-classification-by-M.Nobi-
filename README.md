## Introduction

### Program Overview
This project was done as a part of "Bytes of Intelligence: Data Science and AI Internship Program," which provides a comprehensive learning experience in data science and AI through workshops, challenges, and mentorship. This program is an innovative platform designed to propel aspiring data scientists and AI enthusiasts into the forefront of technological advancement and real-world problem-solving.

## Data Source

### Dataset Overview
The dataset for the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Challenge is a comprehensive collection of annotated images representing various common diseases affecting cassava plants, one of the most crucial crop resources in tropical and subtropical regions. It includes thousands of high-resolution images categorized into several disease classes, as well as a category for healthy leaves. This provides 5 folders/classes of data; some data are incorrect as inside one named folder, one may find data of another folder. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with most images representing Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD).

### Accessing the Dataset
The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and collaborative projects.
